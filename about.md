- A search box that allows you to search for a demon in the list by name
- Page navigation buttons that allow you to navigate through the list
- Buttons that allow you to switch between the TSL and the TSL+
- Text on a demon's search box that states its position on the list (If on the list and the text is enabled in the mod settings)
